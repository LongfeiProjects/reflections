How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    compare them by the prefix + or -

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    version control I guess

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: save when you want, more control
    cons: may consume time on trival savings

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Better to save multiple files (btw: how does one file know which files are connected to it, is it automatically done or mannually?)

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to view the commitments history, and git diff to compare two of them by their IDs. However, only one ID to git diff also works. why?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Sure, that's what bring me here

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Make some persional project, and less messed up cases
