When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work localk?

In this way, work can be shared with others, cooperation...

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks: it is a concept ONLY between two GitHubs. Your GitHub copy respository from other's GitHub, and all done under GitHub, nothing happens locally.

close: it is used for two cases: 1. copy repository from GitHub(may belongs to anybody) down to your local. 2. clone repository from your local to your local(another place maybe).

branch: branch is a more lower lever concept inside a repository, on the commits. It creats another thread to work on besids mater thread.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

do not understand the question.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

email, USB drivers. Git/GitHub is more convenient.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

To do something in caution, need suggestions from others, testing. But not mess up with the main stream of master.
